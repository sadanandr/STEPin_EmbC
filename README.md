The Vehicle Seat Temperature Monitoring System is capable of maintaining of Temperature in the vehicles seats. In Western countries, the temperature is very low and The electronic designer should make sure that his technological device should work efficiently in cold weather. In this project, the sensor will detect, if the driver has been seated or not and if the driver is seated then he need to set the temperature accordingly. Based on that the controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and a UART display will display the requested temperature.In this project we have used ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor, Switch, Heat generator, LED and UART diplay,etc.
