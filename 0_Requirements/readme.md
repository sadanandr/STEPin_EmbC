Introduction
Now-days everyone is looking for automation and advancements in all the sectors. The Vehicle Seat Temperature Monitoring System is capable of maintaining of Temperature in the vehicles seats. In Western countries, the temperature is very low and The electronic designer should make sure that his technological device should work efficiently in cold weather. In this project, the sensor will detect, if the driver has been seated or not and if the driver is seated then he need to set the temperature accordingly. Based on that the controller will set the heater to required temperature. The Heater will generate the heat and a UART display will display the requested temperature.In this project we have used ATmega328 microcontroller along with temperature sensor, Switch, Heat generator, LED and UART diplay,etc.

Features
->The System will sense is driver or passenger seated or not.
->Driver or Passenger has the access to modify the temperature in the vehicle.
->As per Drivers request, Heater will generate the heat accordingly.
->It is best for European Countries.
->Low cost and robust system.
->Modular Approach.
